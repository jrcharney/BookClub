# Age Restriction System

Libraries are under attack by sectarian fundamentalists who have taken over the conservative party (which they are using so that be shielding themselves with politics so that nobody can have a healthy conversation and call out what they are really trying to do) in this country which instructs them that anything that is against their agenda is "woke" or "trying to indoctrinate your children" or "grooming their children".  All of this can be described with an eight letter word that would be unprofessional to use in this documentation.

For years, library systems, including the St. Louis County Public Library, have had book rating systems that indicate the level of appropriate reading according to age.  In short, this should ensure that no Kindergartner is reading *Fifty Shades of Grey*.

However, there is no rating system for the cultural experiences.  Parent should not censor their children from learning about other cultures out of fear that their children will be taught to hate themselves. And hiding those dark chapters in history so they don't find out about it is wrong!

We will not bend to those sort of people because of their subjective emotions or nuanced racism and xenophobia promoted by a group of people who are upset that cartoon characters are drawn with a new pair of shoes.

## The rating system

| Level | Age Access | Notes |
|-------|------------|-------|
| 1     | All Ages   | At this level, young children (even those under five) may access books. Think of this as the "TV-Y" rating. Regardless parents should read with their children. |
| 2     | 6+         | These books are accessible to children over the age of 6.  Think of this as your "TV-Y7" rating. |
| 3     | 9+    | These books are accessible to children over the age of 9. If Mom and Dad aren't ready to start talking to their kids about controversial stuff, they're going to have a bad time being a parent after this point. |
| 4     | 12+   | These books are accessible to children over the age of 12. Teen level reading access granted. |
| 5     | 14+   | These books are accessible to teens over 14. Think of this as the "TV-14" rating. If there is a book you want to read that is above this level, you'll want to ask your parents first. |
| 6     | 16+   | These books are accessible to teens over 16. Account emancipation access may be enabled. If applied, user will have access to almost all books. Obviously, we don't want them reading Ayn Rand or a book by a certain dictator. You'll need to contact a moderator if there's a book you absolutely need to read. |
| 7     | 18+   | Complete full access. You're a legal adult at this point. Have at it! |
