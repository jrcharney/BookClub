# Book Club Documentation

This directory contains information about this project.  For instance, Jason put some markdown files that have some [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) syntax in them because GitHub recongizes it.

In the diagrams folder, there will be class diagrams that explain some of the classes as well as Entity Relationship (ER) diagrams that show what the database probably should look like.
