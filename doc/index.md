# Book Club Documentation

This directory contains information about this project.  For instance, Jason put some markdown files that have some [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) syntax in them because GitHub recongizes it.

In the diagrams folder, there will be class diagrams that explain some of the classes as well as Entity Relationship (ER) diagrams that show what the database probably should look like.

* [Routes](routes.md)
* [Features](features.md) - What's in our app that stands out from the competition.
* [Age Limits](age_limits.md) - A system where books are restricted based on the age of the user
* [Wish List](wish_list.md) - Things we don't have time for but could do someday
